# PoE Archnemesis Tracker

This simple React website is used to keep track of the monster recipes for the [Archnemesis League](https://www.pathofexile.com/siege) in [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/).

The challenge of this league was to collect a number of unique monster types and use them in [recipes](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/List_of_Archnemesis_modifiers_in_Archnemesis_league) to upgrade and recieve rewards.

The difficulty with this involved keeping track of your collected monsters and knowing which recipes you had available and which you should do to work towards your ultimate goal.
